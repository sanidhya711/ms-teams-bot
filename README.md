i havent tested it much since im too lazy to wake up for my classes so it might be broken
DONT Blame ME IF IT DOSENT WORK PrOPeRLy !!/$@!**!  
  
STEPS:  
1: download this repository  
2: extract the folder  
3: navigate to the extracted folder using the command line  
5: run "npm install puppeteer" in the command line  
6: run "node ." in the command line  
  
and ur done  
  
Notes:  
• it will not leave the classes on time since many teachers(at my school) sometimes take extra time so it will leave when there are less than 25 kids in the class(u can chage the limit that is 25 by default)  
• please run it before the first class starts otherwise it might crash  
• dont click anything on the chromium window that opens automatically(why would u want to use chromium...are you a peasant?)  
• it will join the first class from the left if there are multiple classes at the same time  
• you have to run "npm install puppeteer" only for the first time  
• if you see any weird errors in the command line at any time terminate the task by clicking ctrl+c in the command line and join the classes manually(if you want to)
